# Quantum-information-processing

-Introduction; logical gates for regular and for reversible computation; waves and particles; Mach-Zehnder interferometer;
 Intuition via quantum candies.

-Quantum mechanics - formalism: states, measurements, transformations, qubits (two-level systems), 
 observables and expectation values, a quantum particle in an infinite/finite well.

-Classical and quantum information theory: Entropy, information; communication channels; distinguishing two orthogonal(quantum) states; 
 correlations between two systems; no cloning - of nonorthogonal states; density matrices and mixed states; interaction with the environment; 
 the most famous cat!

-Entanglement: Bell states, EPR paradox, teleportation, Bell's inequalities.

-Quantum gates: Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli matrices, and set of gates for universal quantum computing; 
 Proof of universality of the Deutsch gate.

-Quantum algorithms and computation: Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon and Grover algorithm.

-Shor's factorization algorithm.

-Quantum Cryptography: Quantum Key Distribution, BB84 protocol; Security of QKD.

-Other topics will be briefly discussed. These may include: error correction, modern cryptology, implementations of qubits,
 generalized operations in quantum physics.
